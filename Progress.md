# Level 1: Modeling

## Part 1: Creating a donut using Torus Mesh because donut is look like torus.

### 1. First we have to make a torus with this properties
#### Torus properties:
* Major Segments = 26 and Minor Segments = 14 (Don't make too large segments because it will help us modeling more easier)
* Major radius: 0.05m (Radius of donut)
* Minor radius: 0.023 (Radius of height donut, maybe the fat of donut)
